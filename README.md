# HomeApplianceRental
This is my personal project of using C#.net and Microsoft SQL database.
-Visual Studio 2015 or above is recommended to run the project.


#Usage
There are two types of users in this application.
Admin and Customer.
Admin account is: Name= Admin
                  Password = Admin123
                  
Customer accounts can be created by clicking `Registr` link-button.

#`Admin`
Admin can basically do CRUD process of home appliances for the application.

#`Customer`
Customer can add items into cart and rent.
Customer must choose rental period before renting an appliance. Each appliance has minimum rental period.
